# CRYSTALS-KYBER JavaScript

**CRYSTALS-KYBER** is a post-quantum key exchange protocol.

This protocol is used to securely establish symmetric keys between two parties. 

This JavaScript implementation is intended for client-side web browser applications and server-side backends in Node.js frameworks.

Most of this code was translated from a Go implementation of Kyber which can be found [here](https://github.com/symbolicsoft/kyber-k2so).

Original code (written in C) can be found [here](https://github.com/pq-crystals/kyber).

Kyber comes in 512, 768, 1024 security strengths.

This code is the most up to date version based off the [NIST PQC Round 3 Submissions](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography/round-3-submissions).

## Functionality

**KYBER** will securely distribute a 256 bit symmetric key between two parties. To safely transmit data over a channel using the key, an AEAD is advised (such as AES-256-GCM).

The exchange can be visualised below:

## Usage
Using Node.js (v16.17.0) or React:
```bash
npm install crystals-kyber
```
Import the module at the top of your js file.
```js
const kyber = require('crystals-kyber');
```
To use in your code (768 can be replaced with 512 or 1024).
```js
// To generate a public and private key pair (pk, sk)
let pk_sk = kyber.KeyGen768();
let pk = pk_sk[0];
let sk = pk_sk[1];

// To generate a random 256 bit symmetric key (ss) and its encapsulation (c)
let c_ss = kyber.Encrypt768(pk);
let c = c_ss[0];
let ss1 = c_ss[1];

// To decapsulate and obtain the same symmetric key
let ss2 = kyber.Decrypt768(c,sk);
```
## Running Kyber in browser

Install browserify and create a file named main.js, with the following code inside:

```js
const kyber = require('crystals-kyber');

// To generate a public and private key pair (pk, sk)
let pk_sk = kyber.KeyGen768();
let pk = pk_sk[0];
let sk = pk_sk[1];

// To generate a random 256 bit symmetric key (ss) and its encapsulation (c)
let c_ss = kyber.Encrypt768(pk);
let c = c_ss[0];
let ss1 = c_ss[1];

// To decapsulate and obtain the same symmetric key
let ss2 = kyber.Decrypt768(c,sk);
```

Now in terminal, do this: 
``` bash
browserify main.js > bundle.js -d 
```
and include the bundle file in your static js folder and make sure to include the bundle script tag in the HTML file as well.

// Test function with KATs
kyber.Test768();
```
## Running Tests
